# Rook Fait Suit Up Challenge
**Game:** Farm Defense\n
**Objective:** Defend yourself against a UFO abducting your cows and shooting them at you! Use your chicken gun to shoot eggs at the UFO and bring it down!\n

# Challenge Specifics
**Codebase:** The codebase is thorougly documented & typechecked to ensure clarity for other developers and simplify reviewing. In addition, composure is used in some systems such as the UFO where the launcher is used to launch cows at the player. All programming decisions are also thoroughly commented to explain my technical thought process.\n\n
**Physics Integration:** Physics is an essential part of gameplay because both the attacking UFO and you use projectile-based weapons. Physics are integrated through the FastCastRedux dependency.\n\n
**Humor:** Humor is implemented through the sound effects ingame as well as the game itself. The idea of a UFO stealing your cows and shooting them at you and using a chicken to shoot eggs are both comical aspects of gameplay.
